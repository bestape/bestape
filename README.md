### Hello visitor!  ðŸ‘‹

My work for the past few years has focused on the intersection of non-halting mathematics and computer science. 

In other words, how can we better understand and leverage recursive patterns? 

Here's an example of the famous Golden Ratio as a simple recursive cellular automaton:

I've published some of my work on the OEIS:

* How to approximate (1 + sqrt(7))[https://oeis.org/A297189] with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate 1 + 2*sqrt(2) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate 1 + sqrt(10) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate 1 + sqrt(11) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate 1 + 2*sqrt(3) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate 1 + 3*sqrt(2) with a natural number sequence.
