### hello visitor!  ðŸ‘‹

My focus for the past few years has been on the intersection of non-halting mathematics and computer science. 

The questions I've asked with prolonged contemplation include:

* How can we better understand and leverage recursive patterns?

* What's the difference between recursion and iteration? 

### discoveries

Here's an example of the famous Golden Ratio as a simple recursive cellular automaton:

Here's an example of a Pythagorean triple, generated by [this alchemy repository](https://github.com/bestape/alchemy):

* `( c - b ) / a = x^1` moves toward the vanishing point. (Myself).

* `x^0 = 1` is the current position. (Me).

* `a / ( c - b ) = x^-1` moves away from the vanishing point. (I).
