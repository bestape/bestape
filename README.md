### Hello visitor!  ðŸ‘‹

My work for the past few years has focused on the intersection of non-halting mathematics and computer science. 

In other words, how can we better understand and leverage recursive patterns? 

Here's an example of the famous Golden Ratio as a simple recursive cellular automaton:

### My work on the OEIS:

* How to approximate [1 + sqrt(7)](https://oeis.org/A297189) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [1 + 2*sqrt(2)](https://oeis.org/A328604) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [1 + sqrt(10)](https://oeis.org/A328605) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [1 + sqrt(11)](https://oeis.org/A328606) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [1 + 2*sqrt(3)](https://oeis.org/A164544) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [1 + 3*sqrt(2)](https://oeis.org/A330390) with a natural number sequence.
