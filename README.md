### hello visitor!  ðŸ‘‹

My focus for the past few years has been on the intersection of non-halting mathematics and computer science. 

The questions I've asked with prolonged contemplation include:

* How can we better understand and leverage recursive patterns?

* What's the difference between recursion and iteration? 

### discoveries

Here's an example of the famous Golden Ratio as a simple recursive cellular automaton:

Here's an example of a Pythagorean triple, generated by [this repository](https://github.com/bestape/alchemy):

### My work on the OEIS:

* How to approximate [`1 + 7^(1/2)`](https://oeis.org/A297189) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [`1 + 2*2^(1/2)`](https://oeis.org/A164544) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [`1 + 10^(1/2)`](https://oeis.org/A328604) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [`1 + 11^(1/2)`](https://oeis.org/A328605) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [`1 + 2*3^(1/2)`](https://oeis.org/A328606) with a natural number sequence.

* How to approximate [`1 + 3*2^(1/2)`](https://oeis.org/A330390) with a natural number sequence.
